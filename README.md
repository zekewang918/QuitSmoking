QuitSmoking
===========

Function to calculate the money spent on cigarettes.

1. Use JavaScript to write a calculator that calculates the total cost of smoking cigarettes of the user.

2. Write Jasmine tests to test your JavaScript code. (Expect a value of cost based on a pack type and number of cigarettes.)

3. The calculator should handle different packs of cigarettes.

4. You can have random prices for different pack names, or you can look the price up online.

5. Your code should not be server side. Client side with predefined data set will be fine. You can define your dataset of your choice.â€‹
